        Gets a list of `VariantAnnotation` messages matching the search
        criteria.
      description: >-
        This allows the mining of allele-specific annotations on a VariantSet by

        either a region or by a set of genomic features. Where a region is
        supplied

        annotation of all alleles vs all features in the region is returned.
        Where

        a set of features is supplied, only annotations against these features

        (matching on featuretype and id) are returned and other overlapping

        features are ignored.


        `variantannotationsets/search` returns information on the input to the

        annotation. This will be a VariantSet and the reference data and
        software

        versions used in calculating the annotation. It is essential this

        information is exhaustive.


        `POST /variantannotations/search` must accept a JSON version of

        `SearchVariantAnnotationsRequest` as the post body and will return a
        JSON

        version of `SearchVariantAnnotationsResponse`.
