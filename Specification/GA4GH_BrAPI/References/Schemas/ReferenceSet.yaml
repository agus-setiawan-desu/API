      description: |-
        A `ReferenceSet` is a set of `Reference` s which typically comprise a
        reference assembly, such as `GRCh38`. A `ReferenceSet` defines a common
        coordinate space for comparing reference-aligned experimental data.

        isDerived:
          description: |-
            A reference set may be derived from a source if it contains
            additional sequences, or some of the sequences within it are derived
            (see the definition of `isDerived` in `Reference`).

        md5checksum:
          description: |-
            Order-independent MD5 checksum which identifies this `ReferenceSet`.

            To compute this checksum, make a list of `Reference.md5checksum` for all
            `Reference` s in this set. Then sort that list, and take the MD5 hash of
            all the strings concatenated together. Express the hash as a lower-case
            hexadecimal string.
